If she was flavor, I won't save her 
No taste buds, ho, later! 
Fuck you lookin' at, hater? 
I saw them eyes like an ass raper 
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate 
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass 
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper 
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early 
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty 
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy 
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty 
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy 
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis 
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater 
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos 
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy 
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81 
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap 
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks 
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving 
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey 
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it 
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it 
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous 
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth 
Like a missile, a thunder cloud 
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound 
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground 
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster 
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter 
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener 
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker 
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover 
Hand over the mouth and nose smother 
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover 
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner 
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her 
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando 
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn 
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando 
Your man don't want it 
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah) 
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A 
White Bronco like Elway, speeding 
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in? 
Females stay beating 'em 
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading 
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium 
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt 
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate 
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate 
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made 
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—
