Bitch, you have never said a clever line ever 
You murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth 
Rest assured, I'ma treat this roof like I'm peelin' off 
The plastic on a pill bottle, I'm tearin' the ceilin' off, yeah  
Ripping rappers like they were wrapped in Saran, bitch 
And I'm strapped up with ammunition 
And single-handedly takin' over the game like I had an actual hand missing 
But I only need one to clap 
Animal ambition 
The only butt-fuckin' way that you're strapped is for cash 
Wish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin' imaginary little handgun you're brandishin' 
Bitch, if you pull up with the stick 
It's a car with a manual transmission  
The chances are low to none that I will overcome my bipolar one 
Voodoo dolls, I'm just pokin' fun, pins to me are like loaded guns 
When I'm holdin' one, if I'm just fiddlin' with it 
This motherfucker discharges like me checkin' myself out of the fucking mental hospital 
And I get off like an acquittal, I spit it, you critique it 
It feels like I'm bein' belittled by midgets 
It's like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka 
And walkin' right up in the middle of a little kids' fuckin' pillow fight with it 
You want smoke ? I'm like hookah 
Man, I remember back when I used to get jumped for my fucking Pumas 
Run home and go fuck my room up  
These streets will try to vacuum you up  
That's why the avenue where I grew up was 8 Mile and Hoover (What?) 
'Cause it sucked like a Roomba 
But even if I would've went the indie route 
I don't have any doubt 
I would still get blown like it's windy out 
Shoot 'til the clip is emptied out 
This is the beginning of the ending, but I'll put another clip in and spit these rounds 
If I dig deep down when I'm in my bag like Fendi 
Who am I offending now? 
Got so many fucking detractors, feels like I'm gettin' plowed 
Had to put my money on a diet, I got too many pounds 
You would think I'm turnin' pages the way that I'm flippin' paper 
Middle fingers, them bitches get to wavin' like friendly neighbors 
I'm talkin' loot like I'm rioting  
Dick is so big, I can't fit the entire thing through a tire swing 
I don't think it would be logic for me to say that I'm retirin'  
But I should say bye-bye, earthlings 
'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this "Grindin'" beat, yeah 
I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song 
You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart 
So when I'm rippin' , it's hard to tell whether if it is really because 
Of how offensive I am, or just what a bitch that you are 
Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul 
Like I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and I'm quick on the draw 
Yeah, so when I pull it, surprise ( Pull it, surprise ), like Kendrick Lamar 
You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog 
'Cause y'all are missing a heart 
Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz 
This shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping 
Y'all got detention tomorrow  
I'm severe like Benzo withdrawal  
Bitch, your skin's gonna crawl 
I'm invincible, I've been through it all 
Like I never thought about just ending it 'til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall  
My back was against 
Now I rap like I'm possessed, that's nine-tenths of the law 
Oh 
Oh, fuck it
