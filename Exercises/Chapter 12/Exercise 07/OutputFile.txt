Even though israel is a small country it is always in the news. 
The news continues to report on jews moving to israel, on the 
technology invented there, but also on conflict, wars and 
tensions with surrounding people. Why? A look at israel’s
history in the book of genesis in the bible reveals that
4000 years ago a man, who is now very well known, went on
a camping trip in that part of the world.  The bible says
that his story affects our future.
